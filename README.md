# EEG Emotion Recognition using DEAP Dataset

This project focuses on processing EEG signals from the [DEAP dataset](https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mmv/datasets/deap/) to recognize human emotions. The pipeline includes feature extraction, and classification using deep learning and machine learning models.

## üß† Dataset

The [DEAP]([https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mmv/datasets/deap/](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manh123df/deap-dataset)) dataset is a multimodal dataset for the analysis of human affective states, containing EEG and peripheral physiological signals recorded from 32 participants while watching 40 one-minute music videos.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- Signal segmentation and normalization
- Feature extraction (statistical, frequency-based, or learned features)
- Emotion labeling based on arousal/valence scores
- Deep learning models for emotion classification
- Visualization of results
